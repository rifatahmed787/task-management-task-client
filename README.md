### Introduction

Welcome to the Task Management Frontend! This web application serves as the user
interface for the Task Management platform, where users can keep their daily tasks and they can update and delete their tasks as well. To add the task, the user should create an account first by their name, email, password, and image URL (optional).

The primary objective of this front-end application is to provide users with a
seamless and enjoyable experience while exploring task management. It interacts with the task management API to fetch and display task information, enabling users to search for task, view detailed, and manage their task effectively.
